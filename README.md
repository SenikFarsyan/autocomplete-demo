# Autocomplete Component

This project, "autocomplete-component", utilizes React and TypeScript for building a modern autocomplete user interface component. It leverages Vite for efficient bundling and dev server capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

To get started with the project, run the following commands:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:SenikFarsyan/autocomplete-demo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd autocomplete-component
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Project

To start the development server using Vite, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts the Vite development server, which you can access at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Compile TypeScript files and build the production version with:

```bash
npm run build
```

This produces a production build in the `dist` directory.

## Linting

Ensure your code conforms to best practices by running:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This command checks your TypeScript and React files for linting errors.

## Previewing the Build

After building the project, you can preview the production build locally using:

```bash
npm run preview
```
